There are a number of real estate options in DHA (Defence Housing Authority) in Karachi. You can search online for plots that are available through real estate websites such as Zameen.com. You can also search through other websites and forums, such as Pakistan Property, to find more information about the available plots. Additionally, you can contact local real estate agents or brokers who may be able to help you find a suitable plot.
User: ok yeah but I would like to find them in Islamabad

Unfortunately, DHA is only available in Karachi. You may wish to look for plots available in Islamabad through real estate websites such as Zameen.com or Pakistan Property. Additionally, you can contact local real estate agents or brokers who may be able to help you find a suitable plot in Islamabad.
